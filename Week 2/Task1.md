# Task 1 ‚Äì BabySoC Fundamentals & Functional Modelling

## üìù System-on-Chip (SoC) Overview

A **System-on-Chip (SoC)** integrates all essential electronic components into a single chip. Compared to multi-chip designs, SoCs offer:

- **Enhanced performance** ‚Äì reduced latency via on-chip integration.
- **Lower power consumption** ‚Äì optimized interconnects and power domains.
- **Compact form factor** ‚Äì ideal for mobile, embedded, and IoT devices.

SoCs are used in **smartphones, tablets, IoT modules, edge devices, and embedded systems**.

## üß© Key Components of a Typical SoC

### Central Processing Unit (CPU)

- Acts as the **brain** of the system.
- Executes instructions, performs calculations, and controls data flow.
- Can be **single-core or multi-core** for parallel processing.

### Memory

- **RAM**: temporary storage for fast access.
    - **SRAM** ‚Äì very fast, used for cache/registers.
    - **DRAM** ‚Äì slower, cheaper, used as main memory.
- **ROM**: stores firmware and boot code.
- **Flash Memory**: non-volatile storage for programs and data.

### Peripherals

- Specialized hardware blocks for tasks such as:
    - **GPU** ‚Äì graphics acceleration
    - **DSP** ‚Äì signal processing
    - **Timers & Clocks** ‚Äì synchronization
    - **I/O Interfaces** ‚Äì USB, SPI, I¬≤C, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth

### Interconnect

- Communication backbone for CPU, memory, and peripherals.
- Architectures:
    - **Bus-based** (AMBA, Wishbone)
    - **Network-on-Chip (NoC)** ‚Äì scalable routing for complex SoCs

## üõ†Ô∏è Functional Modeling in SoC Design

Functional modelling is done **before RTL and physical design**, to verify system behavior and guide implementation.

### Roles of Functional Models

- **Exploration & Specification** ‚Äì high-level behavior in C/C++/SystemC; tests architectures and power-performance trade-offs
- **Verification** ‚Äì ensures logical correctness early; catches software/hardware bugs cheaply
- **Bridge to Implementation** ‚Äì serves as a **golden reference** for RTL and physical design
- **System-level Co-Design** ‚Äì enables hardware-software co-development for performance-critical SoCs
