# **📌 Week 2 - Submission**

**This week covers SoC fundamentals and hands-on functional modelling using the VSDBabySoC model:**

### **[Task 1](https://github.com/Govindan-M/riscv-soc-tapeout/blob/main/Week%202/Task1.md)** – Theory (Conceptual Understanding)

- Understand **what a System-on-Chip (SoC) is**.
- Study the **key components**: CPU, memory, peripherals, and interconnect.
- Learn about the **RVMYTH processor core** and its role.
- Explore the **purpose of functional modelling** before RTL and physical design.

### **[Task 2](https://github.com/Govindan-M/riscv-soc-tapeout/blob/main/Week%202/Task2.md)** – Labs (Hands-on Functional Modelling)

- Clone the **VSDBabySoC project repository**.
- Compile the BabySoC **Verilog modules**.
- Simulate and generate **waveform (.vcd) files**.
- Analyze **reset, clocking, and dataflow between modules** using waveforms.
- Document **observations with screenshots and short explanations** of each waveform.
