# 📌 Week 1 -Submission
## **Foundations of RTL Design and Synthesis**

#### This week covers Basic RTL design, synthesis concepts, Optimizations and GLS.

### 👉 **Day 1](https://github.com/Govindan-M/riscv-soc-tapeout/tree/main/Week%201/Day%201) ** - Introduction to Verilog RTL design and Synthesis

### 👉 **Day 2** - Timing libs, hierarchical vs flat synthesis and efficient flop coding styles

### 👉 **Day 3** - Combinational and sequential optmizations

### 👉 **Day 4** - GLS, blocking vs non-blocking and Synthesis-Simulation mismatch

### 👉 **Day 5** - Optimization in synthesis

## 📝 Submission Overview
This repository serves as the official **Week 1 submission** for the Digital VLSI SoC Design program.

- Developed and submitted RTL designs in Verilog covering combinational and sequential circuits
- Practiced simulation using Icarus Verilog and GTKWave, verified waveform outputs
- Performed synthesis using Yosys, applied hierarchical and flat synthesis approaches
- Explored GLS flow, blocking vs non-blocking assignments, and identified synthesis-simulation mismatches
- Applied optimization techniques for area, timing, and power in RTL and synthesized designs
- Submitted consolidated reports, screenshots, and waveforms for review
