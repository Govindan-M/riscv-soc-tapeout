# 🚀 RISC‑V SoC Tapeout - VSD Program 

## 📌 Overview
This repository documents the end-to-end chip design flow, from testing the target application to deploying real-world silicon.

-  Highlights the major steps, expected outcomes, and key constraints for tape-out readiness.
-  Uses open-source EDA tools to cover the complete flow from RTL to GDSII.
-  Below are the topics covering my week-wise progress and learnings.
